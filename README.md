This project quickly parses through restricted cadet information and outputs readable information seperated by company so that the Restrcited Cadet Report is no longer the tedious and dreadful task that it once was.

This project also provides <b> At a Glance <b> information so that it is easier to keep track of analytical trends regarding Cadet Conduct through out the course of this semester.  This data can help inform C-DIV and Cadet Leadership on areas to improve, as well as provides a baseline as to whether or not conduct is increasing or decreasing over time.  This helps to ensure that punishment, or the lack thereof, is distributed appropriately.
